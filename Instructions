Run Sender V4 from B's PI
For the following cmd, be sure to update M's ip num:
Run scp /home/bwang/aes_key.bin marwah555@172.20.10.2:/home/marwah555/ from B's PI
Enter Pass1234 as the password
Run REceiver V5 from M's PI

for wifi:
use phone hotspot, have both connected to same hotspot
run ifconfig in terminal to get wlan inet ip

for perf test:
after starting receiver script in M's Pi,
run sudo perf stat --timeout 10000 -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses,context-switches,branches,branch-misses -p $(pgrep -f ReceiverV5.py) >> receiver_perf_output.txt 2>&1
 in M's terminal

this prints the stats for 10s of execution to the file /home/marwah555/receiver_perf_output.txt

everytime you run the command, it appends the stats, so be sure to label it with the key size.
