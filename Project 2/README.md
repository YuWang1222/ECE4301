Second cryptography project using 2 raspberry pi 5 with Raspi OS. In this project we took a text file and encrypted it using AES, EC, and RSA using RUST language. We compared the three encrpytion/decryption benchmarkings to further analyze which method was more efficient. The comparison was made using data from running a perf test. We also compared the benchmarking with cryptoengine on, to see if there is any increase in efficiency.
